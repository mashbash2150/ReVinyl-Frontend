### **_Description_**

ReVinyl is a hub for record enthusiasts to trade, buy, and discuss their favorite vinyl from today and the past. 
Digital formats and streaming are great and convenient, but the pleasure of an analog music experience where a listener grabs a set of headphones, drops the needle, holds the jacket in their hands, and gets lost in an audio journey is what we're here to support.   

Authenticated ReVinyl users can log in to: 
- View a feed of posts from ReVinyl users looking to buy, sell, or trade records 
- Participate in commentary and discussion with other audiophiles
- View and manage their own musical libraries
