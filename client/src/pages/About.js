        ReVinyl is a hub for record enthusiasts to trade, buy, and discuss their
        favorite vinyls from today and the past. Digital formats and streaming
        are great and convenient, but the ideal a listener experiences music is
        to grab a set of headphones, sit with the vinyl, drop the needle,
        holding the sleeve in your hands, looking at the artwork and getting
        lost in a journey.
